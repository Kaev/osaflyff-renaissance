A drop file is named from its mob id: 20.mdd is aibatt, MDD stands for Monster Drop Data
How you add a drop probability is like this: AddDrop(21,500);

note % are *by 10 !
That would add wooden sword at 50% probability, you can add more of same and it will drop that too.

Penya bags are not calculated in files, theres a new field in mobs called Monster.mobCash, thats the real cash mobs drop.

NPC dialog file use 2 functions :

AddText("Your text here !","State");
AddLink("Title of your link","State");

AddLink add some link at the bottom of Dialog box, when you click on it it call All Text that have same "State"

But when you open dialogbox first time you haven't click on a link, right ? So for this first scrren you have to put "START" for the state.
And when you click on Farewell link, windows close and NPC say his last words. For this you need to use "STOP" state.

here an exemple :

MaDa_Pyre.fnc :

-----------------------------------
AddText("Everything is the Acrobat. The Acrobat is everything. Take a moment to ponder what I have said.","START");
AddLink( "Farewell", "STOP");
AddLink( "Introduction","Introduction");
AddText( "Good bye. Never forget the way of the Acrobat. Ha ha ha!","STOP");
AddText( "My name is Pyre and I am the Acrobat Master. Nice to meet you. Hahaha I am in charge of helping vagrants, who want to become and Acrobat.","Introduction");
-------------------------------------------

For all other link you can put every state you want like :"blabla" or "lalala" or what you have in mind.
Just think that when you click on a link it call "every" AddText line with same "state" value. So you could have more that one line for each link, unless the "farewell" link that allow you to just have one text to say when closing windows.
